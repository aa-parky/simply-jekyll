## I am Parky
Hello! Welcome to my very simple digital garden. I doubt very much that you will find anything of any value here, but please, feel free to look around.

Currently reading[[**Reading**<br><img src="/assets/img/current_read.png">::lsn]] because it is about space. I like space.

This site is being hosted over on [mythic beasts](https://www.mythic-beasts.com) and also self hosted on a Raspberry Pi 4, using the [gemini protocol](https://gemini.circumlunar.space), over at [tilde-pi.org](gemini://tilde-pi.org).

## Background

It is simply a place for me to collate, in public view, some of my personal projects, work and abstractions. 

I find that my ‘digital me’ collects and accumulates a huge amount of stuff. I have an idea for a project, I start to research, collect, accumulate get distracted, move on to something else, accumulate, research, get distracted, move on, well, you get the idea.

This site, whilst a collection of my own notes is to try and keep me honest and focused. Actually finish something I start. To create value in the time I spend researching and reading.  

I am an emergency manager by trade, in the oil & gas industry, based in Aberdeen, Scotland over at Petrofac.

I have reached the afternoon of my life.

### Site Layout & Raghuveer's "Simply Jekyll"

Just a few things that I am trying to understand whilst using jekyll and  [[Simply Jekyll::https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet/simply-jekyll]]; 

- **Page preview** (Move your mouse over the link): [[About]]
- **Transclusion**: Allows you to see a partial view of the contents of the website to the right or the left of the margin.
- **Sidenotes** (Changelog you see on the left is an example of this).
- **Wiki-style link:** Usually wikis allow you to specify links using double bracket, I added it here using liquid. Also added bad-link highlighting
   - Good link: [[Adlerian Teleological Thinking and A Simplified Life]]
   - Bad link: [[Title of a page that doesn't exist]]


Some Less know features:

- Go back to the blog home or to the notes page, and try to right click on any of the entry. [Hint: Zettelkasten]

- Press 'Shift + s' to trigger search

- Click this card[[Memorize me so that you do well in your exams::srs]] looking thing to know how I use my notes. [Hint: SRS]

- My Mug Shot[[<img src="/assets/img/profile2.png">::srs]] on a flashcard.
